# BhinoChats 
### A Next.js and Tailwind CSS based chat application developed by [@Intisar-Ahmad](https://github.com/Intisar-Ahmad).

## Description
BhinoChats is just a practice project for me to learn Next.js and explore APIs like Stream and UI libraries like Shadcn and Tailwind CSS. It is not a production-ready application and is not intended for real-world use. However, it is functional and can be modified to suit your needs. I may change my mind in the future and make it production-ready, but for now, it is just a practice project.

## Features
- User authentication with email and password along with Google and Github OAuth. I used Clerk for authentication just to complete it quickly but you can easily replace that with NextAuth or any other library you want if you prefer more customization and don't want to pay for the service.

- Real-time one on one chats and forums using [Stream](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/nextjs/). (Although I am still working on it at the moment).

- More features will be added soon. Stay tuned!
